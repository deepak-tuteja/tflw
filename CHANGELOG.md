# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows the public line:
`0.1.0` (API-only) → `0.2.0` (browser half) → `1.0.0` (final). Pre-1.0, the shipped API grammar is
frozen additive-only: no existing syntax changes, only new syntax.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-06

First public draft. API-only — the browser half lands in `0.2.0`.

### Added

- `.tflw` DSL: a `tflw.config` dialect (`env`/`defaults`/`session`/`require env`), `test`/`action`/
  `before`/`after` blocks, `import`/`use` for shared actions and a JS/TS escape hatch.
- `api` steps for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH; all four request-body forms (`body { … }`, `body from
  "file"`, `form k=v`, `upload`) plus raw `body text`; named services; per-step `timeout`; `without
  redirects`.
- A closed assertion grammar: `expect` (hard) and `check` (soft) over status/header/`body.<path>`/
  `body text`/`duration`, with `any`/`all` quantifiers and a `not` negation.
- `capture` + chaining (create → use → verify across steps), `let`, and value expressions
  (arithmetic, string interpolation, `today`/`now` date math).
- `unique(...)`/`unique email`/`unique like "…"`/`unique uuid` (collision-safe) and `random number`/
  `random date`/`random of`/`random like "…"`/`random uuid`/`random password [N]` (value-shaped)
  generators; a run seed with `--seed`/`--now` replay. `base64`/`hex`/`url` `encode(...)`/
  `decode(...)` value transforms.
- `session <name>` blocks: run once per run, auto-apply captured headers to every test running
  `as <name>` — no repeated login boilerplate.
- Orchestration: `@tags` + `--tag a,b,c` (comma-separated OR — a test runs if it carries any
  listed tag; combines with `--only` as AND), `retry N` with `flaky` marking, inline (`with each`) and
  file-backed (`.csv`/`.json`) data tables, `--workers N` (in-process, per-file, default 1,
  deterministic under `--seed` at any concurrency).
- Teaching-quality diagnostics: source line + caret + "did you mean", stable `TF0xx` codes, a
  conservative unknown-variable/unknown-service checker pass.
- Reporting: a self-contained, theme-aware `report.html` (step timeline, full request/response
  detail, screenshots-ready layout for `0.2.0`) plus `junit.xml` for CI; secrets (`env(NAME)`) are
  redacted from every report, trace, and CLI line automatically.
- `tflw run` and `tflw init` (scaffolds `tflw.config` + `example.tflw`); `tflw --version`/`-v`.
- Packaged as a single self-contained `dist/cli.js` (esbuild bundle) with zero runtime dependencies.
